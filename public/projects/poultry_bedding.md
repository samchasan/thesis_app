Poultry Bedding is also fairly simple to put together using chaff, just again,
be careful, since it will get everywhere. I recommend layering the chaff beneath
whatever other bedding you have, in order to ensure it stays put.


Otherwise, mix chaff in with your typical bedding and you have more bedding now
for less money! Layer with normal bedding lasagna-like to make sure the stuff
stays in the same place.
