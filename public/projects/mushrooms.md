Mushrooms are a very simple thing to make using chaff. Once you prepare it you just *sit and wait*!

**Steps**
1. • Obtain Chaff
2. • Sterilize Chaff
3. • Mix in spores
4. • Put in airtight container
    * *Make sure to put small airholes in plugged with cotton, felt, or something else that allows air exchange*
5. • Place container in dark area
6. • Wait!

Basically you get chaff from your local roaster, and boil it in water for a long time, to make sure that all the nasty bugs and bacteria are killed off.


Then using cheese cloth or something else, along with some sort of nitrile of polymer gloves, you squeeze as much moisture from the chaff as possible.


Next, mix in mushroom spores. The more the merrier. Make sure they are thoroughly mixed in. Fungus acts differently than plants do, in that each cell is essentially an autonomous body that can link up the whole network of mycelial growth. This is to say, essentially, that rather than suffocate each other by being too close in proximity, more spores cause more growth.  The quicker they can connect to each other the quicker nutrients can move throughout the system, and the healthier your fungus will be.


Once the spores are mixed in and the moisture is mostly gone, shove as much as you can into a mostly sealed container. This container should have some small holes plugged with cotton or fabric, to allow some air to exchange. However you want very little air to exchange. If you dry your mycelium out it will die!


Finally, leave your container in a dark place for a long time. In about a month or two, you will see that white material has completely taken over the chaff!  At this point, you can place your mycelium brick into a planter box full of wood chips, or find a woodpile that needs taking care of. The spores will continue to devour and convert that material, and in all likelihood will bloom beautiful mushrooms just like mine did :)


Good luck and happy running.
