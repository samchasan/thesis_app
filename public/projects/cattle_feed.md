Cattle Feed fairly easy to prepare. Though you need to know your cows.
You can't mix in too much chaff, as it is light and fluffy and will get everywhere,
so just err on the side of caution here.


Apparently the best mixture is around 15% by volume, unless you want your milk
to have a distinct coffee flavor!


It's a fairly simple process, just take the feed you already have, and mix in the Chaff
in different amounts to determine the best ratio for your bovine herd. Then write
it down, save it to a file, or whatever means necessary to keep track of the amount.


Now you have to buy less feed from the local store! You're welcome.
